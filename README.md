# bm14270-spin 
--------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller driver object for the Rohm Semiconductor BM14270 magnetic current sensor.

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* I2C connection at up to 400kHz
* Read current measurement
* Single-shot or continuous measurement operating modes
* Set measurement data rate

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* 1 extra core/cog for the PASM I2C driver

P2/SPIN2:
* p2-spin-standard-library

## Compiler Compatibility

* P1/SPIN1: OpenSpin (tested with 1.00.81)
* P2/SPIN2: FastSpin (tested with 4.1.10-beta)
* ~~BST~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~Propeller Tool~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~PNut~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)

## Limitations

* Very early in development - may malfunction, or outright fail to build
* Doesn't support alerts/interrupts
* No scaled measurement (i.e., amperes) yet

## TODO

- [ ] Implement scaled measurements
- [ ] Implement support for alerts/interrupts
